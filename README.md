# RSRS/systems.reciprocal
This project is part of the [_Reciprocal System Research Society's_] (http://reciprocal.systems) R&D to develop
a Java class library that defines atomic, chemical, astronomical and
metaphysical class libraries based on RS2, the reevaluation of Dewey B. Larson's
[_Reciprocal System of physical theory_] (http://reciprocalsystem.org).

See the [RS2 Research and Discussion forum] (http://reciprocal.systems/phpBB3/)
for discussion of this project.

The RS2 reevaluation holds true to the basic, reciprocal relation between space and time
as a concept of motion (a cross-ratio), but differs from Larson's original research by:

* Incorporating projective geometry to account for scalar, affine and coordinate reference
systems (Larson attempted to use Euclidean geometry, only).
* Adding the "yin" aspect of angular velocity as a primary motion, expressed through the
use of imaginary numbers as rotational operators. (Larson addressed linear/yang relations only.)
* Enforces the concept of "whatever exists in space, also exists in time (and vice-versa)"
idea, past the basic concept of 3D space/clock time balanced by 3D time/clock space.

# Requirements
The following software is being used in this development:

* Java 8 SDK
* Netbeans 8.1 IDE
* Postgresql 9.6 database
* JDBC 4.2
